# social-media-customer-classification
Using Machine Learning Random Forest classification model to classify customers based on purchase instance after viewing an ads, taking age and estimated salary as features. It is built using sklearn, panda and numpy. The quality of the split is optimised/measured using entropy. Random forest was chosen due to it's accuracy, performance, and non-linearity tolerance. That said, please consider the threat of overfitting if you utilised that code for another case.
